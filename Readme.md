### KAD32 Engine Speed Relay Testing and Repair

I own a boat equipped with **KAD32 engines**. After encountering a fault with the speed relay, I decided to investigate how to **repair and test** this component. The document in this repository, [**Testing Speed Relay**](./Testing_Speed_Relay.pdf), shares my findings and provides guidance on diagnosing and testing issues with this part.
